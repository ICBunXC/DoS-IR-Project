The following is a project completed through the Google Cybersecurity
Professional Program. The repository includes two files. One is a Wireshark 
packet capture and the other is an incident report that I wrote.
The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to troubleshoot issues
and respond to cybersecurity incidents.
